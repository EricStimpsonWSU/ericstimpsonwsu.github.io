## Setting Up GitHub Pages
The site is published at https://ericstimpsonwsu.github.io from the main/root

## Setting Up Jekyll with GitHub Actions
Weâ€™re using GitHub Actions to build our site with Jekyll. We created a .github/workflows/jekyll.yml file to define our GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow runs every time we push to the main branch of our repository, and it builds and deploys our Jekyll site to GitHub Pages. We also created an index.md file in the root of our repository to serve as the main page of our blog.

## Creating a Default Layout
We created a _layouts/default.html file to serve as a template for our pages. This file includes placeholders for the title and content of each page, as well as the MathJax script for rendering LaTeX syntax. We can customize this file to add a header or footer, include a navigation menu, or apply CSS styles.

## Creating a Blog Post with MathJax
To display LaTeX math equations in a blog post, include the MathJax script at the end of the file. This will load MathJax from a CDN and enable it to render LaTeX syntax in the blog post.
```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```
