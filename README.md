## Setting Up GitHub Pages
The site is published at https://ericstimpsonwsu.github.io from the main/root

## Setting Up Jekyll with GitHub Actions
Weâ€™re using GitHub Actions to build our site with Jekyll. We created a .github/workflows/jekyll.yml file to define our GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow runs every time we push to the main branch of our repository, and it builds and deploys our Jekyll site to GitHub Pages. We also created an index.md file in the root of our repository to serve as the main page of our blog.
