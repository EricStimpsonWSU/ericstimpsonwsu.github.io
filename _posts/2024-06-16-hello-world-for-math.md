# Hello World for Math

In this post, we're going to look at the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

where:
- `a` and `b` are the lengths of the other two sides,
- `c` is the length of the hypotenuse.
