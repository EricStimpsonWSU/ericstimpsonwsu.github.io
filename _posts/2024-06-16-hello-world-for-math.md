# Hello World for Math

In this post, we're going to look at the Pythagorean theorem.  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares  of the length of the other two sides.  This can be written as:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

where
- `a` and `b` are the lengthos of the other two sides,
- `c` is the length of the hypotenuse.
